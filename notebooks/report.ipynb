        "This project is centered around developing intelligent algorithms for agents to navigate through partially observable environments with optimal reasoning. The primary focus involves implementing an advanced exploration algorithm, based on A*, to enable the agent to effectively address our objectives. The agent's goal is to navigate sensibly within randomly generated rooms. It has to identify specific objects to recognize different room types, locate the target object and reach it. We used NetHack as the foundational framework for this project, offering a rich and complex environment for the development and testing of intelligent exploration algorithms.<br>\n",

Pre-conditioning consists of replacing cells adjacent to the walls with \"fake walls\", ensuring that these changes do not block any path. Thanks to this, A* algorithm is forced to return a path always one cell away from the walls of the original game map. Since the agent can look at adjacent cells, moving to a cell next to a real wall would be unnecessary. Therefore, the conditioned map allows visiting the entire area while reducing the number of steps to be made, improving both efficiency and effectiveness.<br><br>\n",

Comparing the distances and fixing the preconditioning, it is easy to see that the TFFFM distance is better than the Manhattan distance for this problem; still, the difference is not too evident. Instead, fixing the distance and varying the preconditioning shows a much more relevant difference in the number of steps. This means that the preconditioning is very suitable for solving this task and results in a more clever exploration of the map. Thus, we can state that the main factor in decreasing the number of steps taken in an exhaustive exploration of the map is the latter.\n",

We considered the comparison between the executions with our optimizations and without them, fixing the probability threshold to 100% to let the exploration be exhaustive. It is evident that the number of times the agent passes on cells using the optimizations is lower. This can be deduced by seeing that the heatmap concerning the optimizations contains lighter cells and has more defined edges, a symptom of a more precise and efficient exploration. In addition, one can notice the difference in the color bar of the two plots. In the first plot’s color bar the maximum value is greater than 10, meaning that the agent has stepped over more than 10 times over a certain cell.
